After looking at dynamic systems and the mathematical modelling behind them, I was curious about how simplistic a model can be, whilst still exhibiting complex, dynamic properties.

Modelling of a Lorenz attractor defines a particles three-dimensional position over time, given by three simplistic equations. Even simpler though is a De Jong Attractor, which has two time independent governing equations. 

The following images are renders of 1 million iterations for the trajectory of a particle following the De Jong attractor equations; each given unique randomised seed parameters.
