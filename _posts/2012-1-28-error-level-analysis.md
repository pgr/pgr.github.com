Error Level Analysis was a project run from 2010 to 2012 to algorithmically determine the autheniticity of photos. It would take an image, process it, and return a copy of the image with the error levels visualised through out the image. The website was freely avaible from 2010 till 2012, at which stage it was closed down to move on to other projects.

Over that period, 290,000 images were processed with the results served to over 1.5 million people.

In the following example image, the process shows differing error levels throughout, evident by the differing areas of brightness throughout the resulting image. This strongly suggests some form of digital manipulation. Areas to note are the lips and shirt of the models, as well as the eyes. All are at significantly different error levels than their surroundings.
