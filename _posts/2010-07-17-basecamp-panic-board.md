Basecamp is an online project management tool form the folks at 37signals. Its great at what it does, but it also offers great scope for extending its functionality.

In an effort to familiarise myself with Google App Engine, I built up a dashboard which shows the current status of a basecamp project, ranging from completed, in progress or overdue.
